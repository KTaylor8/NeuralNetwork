#import input data from respective columns, with loop to continue doing it #over multiple iterations

#send data to each corresponding input neuron

#wait for code to run, then report output data into spreadsheet for future use

#compare experimental results from neural network to theoretical results, plug #into cost function

#use cost function of past few iterations to alter variables in a positive #direction towards the goal
